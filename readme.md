# Project Overview and Description

I will attempt to make a sports score-tracker app. The app will be a fullstack web application that will let you keep track of the specific sports/game you want to keep track of instead of having to constantly search for your games (useful for sports gamblers like me!). A user will be able to login , add/delete the sports/games, and hopefully as a POSTMVP be able to play with fake money to see how much you would have lost/won(need to research this). I will attempt to build this with react and django.

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.

## V1 V2 V3

### V1

- display all future matches for one sport
- add/delete to your watchlist

### V2

- display multiple sports
- display info for all teams/players (use another API for this?)

### V3

- implement a fake betting system where they can bet and see how much they could have won/lost if they bet

- have user input so they can choose (which date,season,etc)

## MVP

- Content, Layout, Structure
- WireFraming
- Create login Page/user authentication
- Feed Page (where users can browse through games)
- My Team Page (shows what team users want to keep track of)
- CRUD commands
- CSS
- Responsive

## PostMVP

- display multiple sports
- add team/player info (if time permits)
- betting system with fake funds and all the logic behind it
- ui improvement

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into smaller components. Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the portfolio. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the portfolio must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.
